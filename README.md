Summer 2021 - Task 7
Task Description 📄

⚙️ Task 7.1 -

📌 In this task you have to create a Web Application for Docker (one of the great Containerization Tool which provides the user Platform as a Service (PaaS)) by showing your own creativity and UI/UX designing skills to make the webportal user friendly.

📌 This app will help the user to run all the docker commands like:
 
  👉docker images
  👉docker ps
  👉docker run
  👉docker rm -f
  👉docker exec
  👉 add more if you want. (Optional) 


In this task we have used python to create our CGI (common gateway interface). For this we have used subprocess module of python to get the output from the terminal where we are running our docker commands. And have also used cgi module of python to get the output from the input field of our front end.
In the frontend we have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interactive web page which can also be used for remote execution program, in which we can run linux commands which we are using for docker also.
